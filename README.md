**Dataset Overview:**
**Description**: The dataset used for the Water Quality Prediction project, typically named
water_potability.csv, contains various features that describe the physical and chemical
properties of water, along with a target variable indicating whether the water is potable
(safe for drinking) or not.

**Objective**: The goal of this project is to predict the potability of water based on various
water quality indicators. The dataset includes features such as pH, hardness, and solids, which will be used to classify whether the water is potable (safe to drink) or non-potable
(unsafe).

**Goal**: The project involves applying multiple machine learning models and evaluating their
accuracy in predicting the water quality

**Machine Learning Models Used**
To determine the best model for water potability prediction, trained and evaluated the
following algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. Naive Bayes Classifier
6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
7. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):
